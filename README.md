# TymeTest

# 1
I've only just sketched out the overall look. Card item, initialize api, filter, paging with API.
Load data all, load more.

# 2 
If I had more time, I would do the ssr part of nextjs better. Filter by params and link params in FE.
Adjust some interfaces, add animations to make them smoother and more beautiful.
I'm still missing the filter in FE.
Maybe if necessary add multi-language.
